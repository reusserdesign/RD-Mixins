# RD Mixins

This is a library of helpful Sass and Compass mixins. These exist to maintain DRY coding principles and leverage the browser for redundant tasks such as calculating widths and margins.

## Instructions

Setting up the _rdMixins.scss library is very simple. Add the file to your Sass directory and import the document into your main .scss document. Ex: `@import "_rdMixins";` Once you have done this, you will have access to the library of mixins inside the imported document.
